               The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is
               an information system where documents and other web resources
               are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as
               <a href="https://example.com/" target="_blank" title="새탭에서 열립니다.">https://example.com/</a>
               , which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.
               [1][2] The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext
               Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application
               called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server.
               The World Wide Web is built on top of the Internet, which pre-dated the Web by over two decades.
               English scientist Tim Berners-Lee co-invented the World Wide Web in 1989
               along with Robert Cailliau. He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed
               at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.[3][4] The browser was released outside CERN to
               other research institutions starting in January 1991, and then to the general
               public in August 1991.
